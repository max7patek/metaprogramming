# metaprogramming
CS1501 Student-Taught-Class at the University of Virginia

Welcome to the website and repo for Metaprogramming! I hope you find the
resources here useful. If you are currently taking the class, feel free to
either clone the repo or just download resources as necessary.

You can find slides under [slides](slides) and assignments under
[assignments](assignments). For more information about the class in general,
please see the [syllabus](syllabus.pdf). [Lecture recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLet_jPomQZ-5hoX1HM-Vg_jYHGntvuw3)
are on YouTube.

Please note that the schedule on the syllabus and first slide set needs some
slight tweaking, so please take dates with a grain of salt.

Good luck, have fun, may your Python be magical and ninja-like.
